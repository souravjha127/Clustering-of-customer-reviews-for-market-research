# Clustering-of-customer-reviews-for-market-research
1) OBJECTIVE
To analyze and cluster customer reviews to identify common themes, sentiments, and patterns in customer feedback, thereby enabling businesses to make informed decisions to improve products, services, and customer experience.

2) Here’s the scope of clustering customer reviews in simple terms: 

Grouping Customers: Clustering helps in grouping customers with similar opinions or behaviors. This makes it easier to 
                    understand different types of customers. 

Understanding Feelings: By clustering reviews, businesses can see what customers like or dislike. This helps in knowing how 
                    happy customers are and what needs to be improved. 

Better Marketing: With clustered data, companies can create more personalized ads and offers that appeal to specific groups 
                    of customers. 

Improving Products: Clustering can show common problems or desired features in products, guiding businesses to make better 
                    products. 

Enhancing Service: Knowing different customer groups helps in providing better service, making customers happier and more 
                    loyal. 

Spotting Trends: Clustering can reveal new trends and changes in customer preferences, helping businesses stay ahead.

3)Algorithm(KMeans)

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning.
The main aim of this algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the data point and their corresponding clusters.
How does the K-Means Algorithm Work? The working of the K-Means algorithm is explained in the below steps:

Step-1: Select the number K to decide the number of clusters.
Step-2: Select random K points or centroids. (It can be other from the input dataset).
Step-3: Assign each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K clusters.
Step-4: Calculate the average and place a new centroid of each cluster.
Step-5: Repeat the third steps, until we don't get a saturation point ........ 
Step-6: Now the centroid point will be terms as mean centroid value.
Step-7: The model is ready.
